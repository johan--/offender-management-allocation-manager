    <h1 class="part-title">Updating nDelius</h1>
    <p>
      You may need to ‘link’ nDelius records with information held in NOMIS before you can make
      allocations for some cases.
    </p>

    <p>Start by finding the prisoner in nDelius.</p>

    <p><%=image_tag("ndelius_find_prisoner.png") %></p>

    <p>Go to the ‘Event Details’ page. At the bottom, you will see ‘Search DSS’. Select this. </p>

    <p><%=image_tag("ndelius_dss_results.png") %></p>

    <p>
      You should see a list of cases with matching information. The search will look for
      ‘unique identifiers’ (details that should belong to only one person).
      For example PNC, Prisoner number and CRO.
    </p>

    <p>
      The search will also take into account name and date of date of birth.
      However, as these details can be shared by more than one person they are less reliable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information that matches the nDelius record with the NOMIS record will be highlighted
      in green.
    </p>

    <p>Select ‘View’ to see more details of a possible matching record.</p>

    <p><%=image_tag("ndelius_offender_details.png") %></p>

    <p>You will be able to compare data on the ‘Data Share Offender Details’ page.</p>

    <p>
      Look for matching ‘unique’ information like prisoner number or PNC rather than only
      names and dates of birth.
    </p>

    <p>If there is a positive data match, click’ Update’ to link the records.</p>
