<div class="govuk-grid-column">
  <div class="govuk-body">
    <p>We need the names and job roles of everyone using the service. This usually includes:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Senior probation officers (SPOs)</li>
      <li>Prison offender managers (POMs)</li>
      <li>Case admin staff in the Offender Management Unit</li>
      <li>Local System Admin (LSA)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We also need the email addresses and working pattern for all prison offender managers.</p>

    <p>We have put together a spreadsheet template you can use to gather this information
      (attached to the email).</p>

    <p>[Image of spreadsheet cells here]</p>

    <p>Send the information to the allocations team</p>

    <p>Send the names, roles and email addresses to: <%= mail_to("hmoic@digital.justice.gov.uk")%></p>

    <p>We will give everyone access to the new service and let you know when this has been done.</p>

    <p>Share the information with the Local System Administrator (LSA)</p>

    <p>You need to send the same list of names, roles and, (for POMs only),
      email addresses to the LSA so that they can complete task 2.</p>

    <p>They will also need a copy of this guide.</p>
