    <p>a) Make sure POMs have the right ‘roles’ assigned in NOMIS</p>

    <p>All POMs need to have a new staff role added in NOMIS.</p>
    <p>This will add them to the list of POMs in the new service.</p>

    <p>b) Check all email addresses are up to date in NOMIS</p>

    <p>POMs email addresses stored in NOMIS need to be up to date. That’s because the
  new service will send an email to let POMs know when they have been allocated to a prisoner.
      You should use the most up to date ‘name@justice.gov.uk’ email address.</p>
