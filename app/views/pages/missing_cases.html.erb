    <p>
      Not every case will appear in this service. Sometimes thatâ€™s because a POM does not need
      to be allocated.
    </p>

    <p>Before contacting us, check the offender is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Convicted  -  prisoners on remand do not need a POM</li>
      <li>Over 18 years old - prisoners under 18 do not need a POM</li>
      <li>Not a civil case</li>
      <li>Sentenced - prisoners must have an earliest release date or parole review date in NOMIS</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
