    <p>You are now ready to start making allocations.</p>

    <p>Initially, the allocations you make in the service will need to mirror existing allocations.
      For example, if an offender manager is working with a prisoner, then you will need to assign
      that same offender manager to the prisoner.</p>

    <p>Sign in to <a href="https://moic.service.justice.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">https://moic.service.justice.gov.uk</a> and follow these steps:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>go to ‘make new allocations’</li>
      <li>Select ‘allocate’ by the name of the prisoner you are allocating</li>
      <li>Choose the prison or probation POM who will work with this prisoner</li>
      <li>Click ‘Complete allocation’</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The POM will receive an email to let them know about the allocation.</p>
